This is a jekyll website based on a template made by [codeinfox](https://github.com/codinfox/codinfox-lanyon), which was based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon).

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

The theme supports: 

1. Theme colors: you can choose your favorite theme color
2. Changable sidebar locations
