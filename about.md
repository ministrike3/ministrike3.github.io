My name is Neil Patel; I am a software engineer who loves working on all kinds of cool stuff like Computer Vision, Data Science, and Deep Learning. I will graduate from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign in the Winter of 2018.

# Why This Blog
This blog serves several purposes; the most important is simply as a way to keep track of what I'm working on and a way for me to look back on something if I need a refresher in the future. It serves as a repository of notes on things I found interesting or difficult, posts about events I've attended, and a place for me to expand on my thoughts. If it helps other visitors with something they need, all the better!
