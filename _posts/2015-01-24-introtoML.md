Machine Learning
Inputs ? Program (pramaters, instances) ? prediction


Predictions : 
Binary Classification, Various categorical divisions, 

Regression problem How interested am i in a particular sport? Supervised learning technique (human taught it to machine with example data sets ) 


UNSUPERVISED: make 5 separate catagories, on your own, you decided you algorithm 

Dimensional reduction
preserve all these columns of data, but make it into a very few columns so a human can understand it

Inputs: 
Continuous: Income, age, time spent on page
Categorical: state of residence, children, martial status
Sparse : pages visted, collection of pixels; DON?T HAVE TOO Much info, only a few pieces of random data
