### What is OpenCV?
* Open source computer vision library in C/C++. Wrappers are provided for languages including Python. 
* Optimized and intended for real-time applications. 

***

### What is it used for?
* Image data manipulation
* Image and video I/O 
* Matrix and vector manipulation and linear algebra routines (products, solvers, eigenvalues, SVD).
* Basic image processing (filtering, edge detection, corner detection, sampling and interpolation, color conversion, morphological  operations, histograms, image pyramids).
* Structural analysis (connected components, contour processing, distance transform, various moments, template matching, Hough transform, polygonal approximation, line fitting, ellipse fitting, Delaunay triangulation).
* Motion analysis (optical flow, motion segmentation, tracking).
* Object recognition (eigen-methods, HMM).
